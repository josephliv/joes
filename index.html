              ‚ÄúOur non-profit, DART, Inc., needed a total website makeover. Joe
              listened to our needs and goals and created us a wonderful new
              site meeting all of requirements. Joe is a pleasure to work with
              and goes out of his way to make the process enjoyable, fast and
              professional.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI hired Joe to re-do my law firm‚Äôs website. I loved my old website,
            but after nearly twenty years with the company that had designed and
            built it for me, I had grown unhappy with the deterioration in the
            level of service I was receiving from that company and my site was
            losing visibility. A good friend referred me to Joe. The old site
            was not built on a well-known platform, but Joe was able to copy all
            of the content from my own site ‚Äî most of which I had written myself
            ‚Äî and use it in the new site. Joe was a pleasure to work with. He
            was prompt, knowledgeable, he kept me informed, he listened to me,
            and his fees were reasonable. I highly recommend him.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúJoe is GREAT to work with. Super responsive and as a non-technical
            person, I really appreciate that he would explain what I needed to
            provide or expect when incorporating the changes and things I wanted
            my website to do. I highly recommend!‚Äù

            ‚ÄúJoe was an absolute pleasure to work with! Our company needed a
            last minute website creator to assist with finishing up our website
            by the end of the year. I found Joe and he completely took the
            weight off my shoulders! He‚Äôs experienced, knowledgeable, extremely
            kind, understanding, and accommodating. He was able to accomplish
            everything I wanted in just 3 days. I appreciated that he really
            took the time and effort to frequently communicate with me to make
            sure my expectations were being met. I will be keeping in touch for
            future projects and any website assistance! Thank you Joe!!! üòä‚Äú
