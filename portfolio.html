              “I hired Joe to re-do my law firm’s website. I loved my old
              website, but after nearly twenty years with the company that had
              designed and built it for me, I had grown unhappy with the
              deterioration in the level of service I was receiving from that
              company and my site was losing visibility. A good friend referred
              me to Joe. The old site was not built on a well-known platform,
              but Joe was able to copy all of the content from my own site —
              most of which I had written myself — and use it in the new site.
              Joe was a pleasure to work with. He was prompt, knowledgeable, he
              kept me informed, he listened to me, and his fees were reasonable.
              I highly recommend him.”

              last minute website creator to assist with finishing up our
              website by the end of the year. I found Joe and he completely took
              the weight off my shoulders! He’s experienced, knowledgeable,
              extremely kind, understanding, and accommodating. He was able to
              accomplish everything I wanted in just 3 days. I appreciated that
              he really took the time and effort to frequently communicate with
              me to make sure my expectations were being met. I will be keeping
              in touch for future projects and any website assistance! Thank you
